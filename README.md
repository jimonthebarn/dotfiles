# dotfiles
Personal collection of dotfiles I currently use in combionation with the zsh shell on OSX Sierra (untested with other shells so be warned).

Installation:

- clone repository into your home directory.
- make setup.sh executable e.g. chmod +x setup.sh
- run setup.sh (this will create the required symlinks and backup a previously existing .zshrc to .zshrc.backup)
