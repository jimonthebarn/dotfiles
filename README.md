# dotfiles

Personal collection of dotfiles I currently use in combination with the zsh shell on OSX Monterey (untested with other
shells so be warned).

```
This is currently work in progress. Please be advised that installation may fail horribly and kittens may die.
```

Install by running the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jimonthebarn/dotfiles/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
